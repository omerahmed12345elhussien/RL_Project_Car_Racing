# RL_Project_Car_Racing

In this project, we are interested in training the DQN and A2C agents on [Car-Racing_v0](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/car_racing/) environment.  The Car-Racing environment is part of the [Box2D](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/) environments. 

In the video below, we present samples of interactions with the environment.
